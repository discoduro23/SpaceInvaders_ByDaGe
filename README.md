# Space Invaders
Small Javascript Space Invaders Game

### Tasks
- [x] **(1 point)** Player moves when keys are pressed and collides with the borders of the game
- [x] **(2.0 point)** You must create an army of enemies similar to the original game.
You should use different images to represent the different enemies (search them on the internet and use the “original” ones).
- [x] **(2.0 point)** Enemies move horizontally until any of the enemies hit the wall, then the whole army goes down a “level”.
- [x] **(1 point )** The enemies should perform an animation when moving as in the original game (two-frame animations where you switch the image to the next one)
- [ ] **(1.5 point)** Player can shoot at a controlled rate of fire; it is a cannon, not a machine gun, so there is some reload time after each shoot. Bullets from player can hit one invader and destroy it.
- [ ] **(1.5 point)** Invaders in front line also shoot from time to time. Bullets from invader can hit the player and take a life from him. The player will have three lives, and if runs out of lives (or the invaders reach the surface of the earth) will die and the game will restart in the current level
- [ ] **(1 point)** In the original game, some coverage was provided to the player through 4 small  uildings that could be destroyed. In the original game they could be destroyed by both (enemies and player) and was partially destroyed with each hit, *can you achieve this?*
- [ ] **(1 point)** Difficulty will be introduced by the enemy’s speed and rate of fire and will be based on a control variable. Each time you kill an invader, difficulty will be increased. When you finish one level, next level will start with increased difficulty.
- [ ] **(1 point)** **Extra features** present in the original game, audio linked to the speed, flying saucer, Hud for score/lives.
